change message structure to serve not just text base message.
each time user open new channel tab, browser needs to create new socket listener
a listener to serve text base only considered wasting and creating another sockets to serve non text message is just too expensive.
message structure change from:
{
	'message': $text_message,
	'channel': {
		id: $channel_id
	},
	'sender': $username
}
to:
{
	meta: {
		type: $message_type [message,join,typing,leave]
	},
	channel:{
		id: $channel_id
	},
	text: $string_text,
	sender: $username,
}

implements user online on channels, tab click, and channel click
join channel already works, but leave channel probably not

redis data
there are 3 keys
user has 2 keys, 
1. user data itself, key with prefix 'Session.${django session id}', (redis hash type)
2. channel that a user has join, key with prefix 'User.Join.${django session id}',  (redis set type)
channel has 1 key, contains list of user id, key with prefix 'Channel.Users.${channel id}' (redis set type)
